## Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

This Python code implements a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on several features, including some relevant to the question: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Here's a breakdown of the process:

**1. Data Exploration:**

- We first explore the data using various descriptive statistics and visualizations like heatmaps to understand its distribution and relationships between features.

**2. Feature Selection:**

- We then select specific features deemed influential for predicting house prices, focusing on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms as requested. Other features like average area income or population might also be included for a more comprehensive model.

**3. Model Training and Fitting:**

- We divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the linear regression model, which learns the relationship between the selected features and the actual house prices.

**4. Predictions and Evaluation:**

- The model is then used to predict prices for the unseen test data. We compare these predictions with the actual prices to assess the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

**5. Visualization and Interpretation:**

- We visualize the distribution of prediction errors and analyze the coefficients associated with each feature. This helps us understand how much each feature affects the predicted price and identify potential areas for improvement.

**Overall, this code demonstrates a basic framework for using linear regression to predict house prices. While it addresses the requested features, further refinements like feature engineering, exploring different models, and checking assumptions can enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.**
